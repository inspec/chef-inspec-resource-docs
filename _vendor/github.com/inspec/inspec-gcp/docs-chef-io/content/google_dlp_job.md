Use the `google_dlp_job` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud Job resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_dlp_job(parent: "projects/#{'chef-gcp-inspec'}/locations/#{'us-east-2'}", name: 'i-inspec-gcp-dlp') do
  it { should exist }
  its('name') { should cmp 'i-inspec-gcp-dlp' }
  its('type') { should cmp 'INSPECT_JOB' }
  its('state') { should cmp 'ACTIVE' }
  its('inspectDetails.requestedOptions.snapshotInspectTemplate') { should cmp '' }
