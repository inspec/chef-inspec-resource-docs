Use the `google_compute_region_ssl_policy` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud RegionSslPolicy resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_compute_region_ssl_policy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: ' value_region', sslPolicy: ' ') do
	it { should exist }
	its('kind') { should cmp 'value_kind' }
	its('id') { should cmp 'value_id' }
	its('creation_timestamp') { should cmp 'value_creationtimestamp' }
	its('self_link') { should cmp 'value_selflink' }
	its('self_link_with_id') { should cmp 'value_selflinkwithid' }
	its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }
	its('description') { should cmp 'value_description' }
	its('profile') { should cmp 'value_profile' }
	its('min_tls_version') { should cmp 'value_mintlsversion' }
	its('fingerprint') { should cmp 'value_fingerprint' }
	its('region') { should cmp 'value_region' }

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_region_ssl_policy` resource:


  * `kind`: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#sslPolicyfor SSL policies.

  * `id`: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.

  * `creation_timestamp`: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  * `self_link`: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

  * `self_link_with_id`: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.

  * `name`: Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

  * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

  * `profile`: Profile specifies the set of SSL features that can be used by the load balancer when negotiating SSL with clients. This can be one of COMPATIBLE, MODERN, RESTRICTED, or CUSTOM. If using CUSTOM, the set of SSL features to enable must be specified in the customFeatures field.
  Possible values:
    * COMPATIBLE
    * CUSTOM
    * MODERN
    * RESTRICTED

  * `min_tls_version`: The minimum version of SSL protocol that can be used by the clients to establish a connection with the load balancer. This can be one of TLS_1_0, TLS_1_1, TLS_1_2.
  Possible values:
    * TLS_1_0
    * TLS_1_1
    * TLS_1_2

  * `enabled_features`: [Output Only] The list of features enabled in the SSL policy.

  * `custom_features`: A list of features enabled when the selected profile is CUSTOM. The method returns the set of features that can be specified in this list. This field must be empty if the profile is not CUSTOM.

An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the SslPolicy, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an SslPolicy.

  * `warnings`: [Output Only] If potential misconfigurations are detected for this SSL policy, this field will be populated with warning messages.

    * `code`: [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
