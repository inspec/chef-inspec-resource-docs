## Parameters

Parameters that can be accessed from the `google_data_fusion_instance` resource:

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_data_fusion_instance` resource:


  * `name`: Output only. The name of this instance is in the form of projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}.

  * `description`: A description of this instance.

  * `type`: Required. Instance type.
  Possible values:
    * TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
    * BASIC
    * ENTERPRISE
    * DEVELOPER

  * `enable_stackdriver_logging`: Option to enable Stackdriver Logging.

  * `enable_stackdriver_monitoring`: Option to enable Stackdriver Monitoring.

  * `private_instance`: Specifies whether the Data Fusion instance should be private. If set to true, all Data Fusion nodes will have private IP addresses and will not be able to access the public internet.

  * `network_config`: Network configuration for a Data Fusion instance. These configurations are used for peering with the customer network. Configurations are optional when a public Data Fusion instance is to be created. However, providing these configurations allows several benefits, such as reduced network latency while accessing the customer resources from managed Data Fusion instance nodes, as well as access to the customer on-prem resources.

    * `network`: Optional. Name of the network in the customer project with which the Tenant Project will be peered for executing pipelines. In case of shared VPC where the network resides in another host project the network should specified in the form of projects/{host-project-id}/global/networks/{network}. This is only required for connectivity type VPC_PEERING.

    * `ip_allocation`: Optional. The IP range in CIDR notation to use for the managed Data Fusion instance nodes. This range must not overlap with any other ranges used in the Data Fusion instance network. This is required only when using connection type VPC_PEERING. Format: a.b.c.d/22 Example: 192.168.0.0/22

    * `connection_type`: Optional. Type of connection for establishing private IP connectivity between the Data Fusion customer project VPC and the corresponding tenant project from a predefined list of available connection modes. If this field is unspecified for a private instance, VPC peering is used.
    Possible values:
      * CONNECTION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
      * VPC_PEERING
      * PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT_INTERFACES

    * `private_service_connect_config`: Configuration for using Private Service Connect to establish connectivity between the Data Fusion consumer project and the corresponding tenant project.

      * `network_attachment`: Required. The reference to the network attachment used to establish private connectivity. It will be of the form projects/{project-id}/regions/{region}/networkAttachments/{network-attachment-id}.

      * `unreachable_cidr_block`: Optional. Input only. The CIDR block to which the CDF instance can't route traffic to in the consumer project VPC. The size of this block should be at least /25. This range should not overlap with the primary address range of any subnetwork used by the network attachment. This range can be used for other purposes in the consumer VPC as long as there is no requirement for CDF to reach destinations using these addresses. If this value is not provided, the server chooses a non RFC 1918 address range. The format of this field is governed by RFC 4632. Example: 192.168.0.0/25

      * `effective_unreachable_cidr_block`: Output only. The CIDR block to which the CDF instance can't route traffic to in the consumer project VPC. The size of this block is /25. The format of this field is governed by RFC 4632. Example: 240.0.0.0/25

  * `labels`: The resource labels for instance to use to annotate any related underlying resources such as Compute Engine VMs. The character '=' is not allowed to be used within the labels.

  * `options`: Map of additional options used to configure the behavior of Data Fusion instance.

    * `additional_properties`:

  * `create_time`: Output only. The time the instance was created.
