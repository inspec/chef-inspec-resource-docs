Use the `google_dataproc_metastore_service_backup` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a Google Cloud ServiceBackup resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_dataproc_metastore_service_backup(name: 'value_name') do
	it { should exist }
	its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }
	its('create_time') { should cmp 'value_createtime' }
	its('end_time') { should cmp 'value_endtime' }
	its('state') { should cmp 'value_state' }
	its('description') { should cmp 'value_description' }
end
