describe google_apigee_organization_api(parent: ' value_parent', name: ' value_name') do
	it { should exist }
	its('latest_revision_id') { should cmp 'value_latestrevisionid' }
	its('api_proxy_type') { should cmp 'value_apiproxytype' }
	its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }

end

describe google_apigee_organization_api(parent: ' value_parent', name: "does_not_exit") do
	it { should_not exist }
end
```
