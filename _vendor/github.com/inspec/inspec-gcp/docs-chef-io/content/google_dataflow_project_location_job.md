## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_dataflow_project_location_job` resource:


  * `id`: The unique ID of this job. This field is set by the Dataflow service when the job is created, and is immutable for the life of the job.

  * `project_id`: The ID of the Google Cloud project that the job belongs to.

  * `name`: The user-specified Dataflow job name. Only one active job with a given name can exist in a project within one region at any given time. Jobs in different regions can have the same name. If a caller attempts to create a job with the same name as an active job that already exists, the attempt returns the existing job. The name must match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]{0,1022}[a-z0-9])?`

  * `type`: The type of Dataflow job.
  Possible values:
    * JOB_TYPE_UNKNOWN
    * JOB_TYPE_BATCH
    * JOB_TYPE_STREAMING

  * `environment`: Describes the environment in which a Dataflow Job runs.

    * `temp_storage_prefix`: The prefix of the resources the system should use for temporary storage. The system will append the suffix "/temp-{JOBNAME} to this resource prefix, where {JOBNAME} is the value of the job_name field. The resulting bucket and object prefix is used as the prefix of the resources used to store temporary data needed during the job execution. NOTE: This will override the value in taskrunner_settings. The supported resource type is: Google Cloud Storage: storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{object} bucket.storage.googleapis.com/{object}

    * `cluster_manager_api_service`: The type of cluster manager API to use. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. This should be in the form of the API service name, e.g. "compute.googleapis.com".

    * `experiments`: The list of experiments to enable. This field should be used for SDK related experiments and not for service related experiments. The proper field for service related experiments is service_options.

    * `service_options`: The list of service options to enable. This field should be used for service related experiments only. These experiments, when graduating to GA, should be replaced by dedicated fields or become default (i.e. always on).

    * `service_kms_key_name`: If set, contains the Cloud KMS key identifier used to encrypt data at rest, AKA a Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK). Format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/KEY

    * `worker_pools`: The worker pools. At least one "harness" worker pool must be specified in order for the job to have workers.

      * `kind`: The kind of the worker pool; currently only `harness` and `shuffle` are supported.

      * `num_workers`: Number of Google Compute Engine workers in this pool needed to execute the job. If zero or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

      * `packages`: Packages to be installed on workers.

        * `name`: The name of the package.

        * `location`: The resource to read the package from. The supported resource type is: Google Cloud Storage: storage.googleapis.com/{bucket} bucket.storage.googleapis.com/

      * `default_package_set`: The default package set to install. This allows the service to select a default set of packages which are useful to worker harnesses written in a particular language.
      Possible values:
        * DEFAULT_PACKAGE_SET_UNKNOWN
        * DEFAULT_PACKAGE_SET_NONE
        * DEFAULT_PACKAGE_SET_JAVA
        * DEFAULT_PACKAGE_SET_PYTHON

      * `machine_type`: Machine type (e.g. "n1-standard-1"). If empty or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

      * `teardown_policy`: Sets the policy for determining when to turndown worker pool. Allowed values are: `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`, `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`, and `TEARDOWN_NEVER`. `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` means workers are always torn down regardless of whether the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS` means workers are torn down if the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_NEVER` means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.
      Possible values:
        * TEARDOWN_POLICY_UNKNOWN
        * TEARDOWN_ALWAYS
        * TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS
        * TEARDOWN_NEVER

      * `disk_size_gb`: Size of root disk for VMs, in GB. If zero or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

        * `base_url`: The base URL for the taskrunner to use when accessing Google Cloud APIs. When workers access Google Cloud APIs, they logically do so via relative URLs. If this field is specified, it supplies the base URL to use for resolving these relative URLs. The normative algorithm used is defined by RFC 1808, "Relative Uniform Resource Locators". If not specified, the default value is "http://www.googleapis.com/"

        * `dataflow_api_version`: The API version of endpoint, e.g. "v1b3"

        * `parallel_worker_settings`: Provides data to pass through to the worker harness.

          * `base_url`: The base URL for accessing Google Cloud APIs. When workers access Google Cloud APIs, they logically do so via relative URLs. If this field is specified, it supplies the base URL to use for resolving these relative URLs. The normative algorithm used is defined by RFC 1808, "Relative Uniform Resource Locators". If not specified, the default value is "http://www.googleapis.com/"

          * `reporting_enabled`: Whether to send work progress updates to the service.

      * `on_host_maintenance`: The action to take on host maintenance, as defined by the Google Compute Engine API.

      * `data_disks`: Data disks that are used by a VM in this workflow.

        * `size_gb`: Size of disk in GB. If zero or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

        * `disk_type`: Disk storage type, as defined by Google Compute Engine. This must be a disk type appropriate to the project and zone in which the workers will run. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in "pd-standard". If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard

    * `name`: The name that identifies the step. This must be unique for each step with respect to all other steps in the Cloud Dataflow job.

    * `properties`: Named properties associated with the step. Each kind of predefined step has its own required set of properties. Must be provided on Create. Only retrieved with JOB_VIEW_ALL.

      * `additional_properties`: Properties of the object.

  * `steps_location`: The Cloud Storage location where the steps are stored.

  * `current_state`: The current state of the job. Jobs are created in the `JOB_STATE_STOPPED` state unless otherwise specified. A job in the `JOB_STATE_RUNNING` state may asynchronously enter a terminal state. After a job has reached a terminal state, no further state updates may be made. This field might be mutated by the Dataflow service; callers cannot mutate it.
  Possible values:
    * JOB_STATE_UNKNOWN
    * JOB_STATE_STOPPED

  * `requested_state`: The job's requested state. Applies to `UpdateJob` requests. Set `requested_state` with `UpdateJob` requests to switch between the states `JOB_STATE_STOPPED` and `JOB_STATE_RUNNING`. You can also use `UpdateJob` requests to change a job's state from `JOB_STATE_RUNNING` to `JOB_STATE_CANCELLED`, `JOB_STATE_DONE`, or `JOB_STATE_DRAINED`. These states irrevocably terminate the job if it hasn't already reached a terminal state. This field has no effect on `CreateJob` requests.
  Possible values:
    * JOB_STATE_UNKNOWN
    * JOB_STATE_STOPPED
    * JOB_STATE_RUNNING

  * `create_time`: The timestamp when the job was initially created. Immutable and set by the Cloud Dataflow service.

  * `replace_job_id`: If this job is an update of an existing job, this field is the job ID of the job it replaced. When sending a `CreateJobRequest`, you can update a job by specifying it here. The job named here is stopped, and its intermediate state is transferred to this job.

  * `transform_name_mapping`: The map of transform name prefixes of the job to be replaced to the corresponding name prefixes of the new job.

    * `additional_properties`:

  * `client_request_id`: The client's unique identifier of the job, re-used across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. The request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client's ID and job name. The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.

  * `replaced_by_job_id`: If another job is an update of this job (and thus, this job is in `JOB_STATE_UPDATED`), this field contains the ID of that job.

  * `temp_files`: A set of files the system should be aware of that are used for temporary storage. These temporary files will be removed on job completion. No duplicates are allowed. No file patterns are supported. The supported files are: Google Cloud Storage: storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{object} bucket.storage.googleapis.com/{object}

  * `labels`: User-defined labels for this job. The labels map can contain no more than 64 entries. Entries of the labels map are UTF8 strings that comply with the following restrictions: * Keys must conform to regexp: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} * Values must conform to regexp: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} * Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be <= 128 bytes in size.
