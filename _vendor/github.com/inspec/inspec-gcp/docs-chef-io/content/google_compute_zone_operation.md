Use the `google_compute_zone_operation` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud ZoneOperation resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_compute_zone_operation(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', zone: 'us-central1-a', name: 'operation-1641188179305-5d4a6e66fe2bd-8fd1812d-d97f3b69') do
it { should exist }
its('name') { should eq 'operation-1641188179305-5d4a6e66fe2bd-8fd1812d-d97f3b69' }
its('status') { should eq '' }
its('progress') { should eq '100' }
end

describe google_compute_zone_operation(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', zone: 'us-central1-a', name: 'nonexistent') do
it { should_not exist }
end
```
