Use the `google_vertex_ai_nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud NasJobsNasTrialDetail resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_vertex_ai_nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail(name: "projects/#{gcp_project_id}/locations/#{nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail['region']}/nasJobs/#{nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail['nasJob']}/nasTrialDetails/#{nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail['name']}", region: ' value_region') do
	it { should exist }
	its('parameters') { should cmp 'value_parameters' }
	its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }

end

describe google_vertex_ai_nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail(name: "does_not_exit", region: ' value_region') do
	it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_vertex_ai_nas_jobs_nas_trial_detail` resource:


  * `parameters`: The parameters for the NasJob NasTrial.

  * `name`: Output only. Resource name of the NasTrialDetail.

  * `search_trial`: Represents a uCAIP NasJob trial.

    * `id`: Output only. The identifier of the NasTrial assigned by the service.

    * `state`: Output only. The detailed state of the NasTrial.
    Possible values:
      * STATE_UNSPECIFIED
