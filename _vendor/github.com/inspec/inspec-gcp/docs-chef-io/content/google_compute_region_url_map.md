## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_region_url_map` resource:


  * `kind`: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url maps.

  * `id`: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.

  * `creation_timestamp`: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  * `name`: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

  * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

  * `self_link`: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

  * `host_rules`: The list of host rules to use against the URL.

    * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

    * `hosts`: The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames with optional port numbers in the format host:port. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). In that case, * must be the first character, and if followed by anything, the immediate following character must be either - or .. * based matching is not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

    * `path_matcher`: The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of the URL if the hostRule matches the URL's host portion.

  * `path_matchers`: The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.

    * `name`: The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.

    * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

    * `default_service`: The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource. This URL is used if none of the pathRules or routeRules defined by this PathMatcher are matched. For example, the following are all valid URLs to a BackendService resource: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project /global/backendServices/backendService - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService - global/backendServices/backendService If defaultRouteAction is also specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect before sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified. Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource default_service: - compute.backendBuckets.use - compute.backendServices.use

    * `default_route_action`:

      * `weighted_backend_services`: A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number. After a backend service is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service, advanced routing actions such as URL rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.

        * `backend_service`: The full or partial URL to the default BackendService resource. Before forwarding the request to backendService, the load balancer applies any relevant headerActions specified as part of this backendServiceWeight.

        * `weight`: Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to a backend service, computed as weight / (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has been directed to a backend service, subsequent requests are sent to the same backend service as determined by the backend service's session affinity policy. The value must be from 0 to 1000.

        * `header_action`: The request and response header transformations that take effect before the request is passed along to the selected backendService.

          * `request_headers_to_remove`: A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request before forwarding the request to the backendService.

          * `request_headers_to_add`: Headers to add to a matching request before forwarding the request to the backendService.

            * `header_value`: The value of the header to add.

            * `replace`: If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that were set for that header. The default value is false.

          * `response_headers_to_remove`: A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response before sending the response back to the client.

          * `response_headers_to_add`: Headers to add the response before sending the response back to the client.

            * `header_name`: The name of the header.

            * `header_value`: The value of the header to add.

            * `replace`: If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that were set for that header. The default value is false.

      * `url_rewrite`: The spec for modifying the path before sending the request to the matched backend service.

        * `path_prefix_rewrite`: Before forwarding the request to the selected backend service, the matching portion of the request's path is replaced by pathPrefixRewrite. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters.

        * `host_rewrite`: Before forwarding the request to the selected service, the request's host header is replaced with contents of hostRewrite. The value must be from 1 to 255 characters.

        * `path_template_rewrite`: If specified, the pattern rewrites the URL path (based on the :path header) using the HTTP template syntax. A corresponding path_template_match must be specified. Any template variables must exist in the path_template_match field. - -At least one variable must be specified in the path_template_match field - You can omit variables from the rewritten URL - The * and ** operators cannot be matched unless they have a corresponding variable name - e.g. {format=*} or {var=**}. For example, a path_template_match of /static/{format=**} could be rewritten as /static/content/{format} to prefix /content to the URL. Variables can also be re-ordered in a rewrite, so that /{country}/{format}/{suffix=**} can be rewritten as /content/{format}/{country}/{suffix}. At least one non-empty routeRules[].matchRules[].path_template_match is required. Only one of path_prefix_rewrite or path_template_rewrite may be specified.

      * `timeout`: A Duration represents a fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". Range is approximately 10,000 years.

        * `seconds`: Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from: 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years

For example, connection timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you can retry is error code 409. - refused-stream: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry. - cancelled: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled. - deadline-exceeded: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded. - internal: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to internal. - resource-exhausted: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to resource-exhausted. - unavailable: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable.

        * `error_response_rules`: Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.

          * `match_response_codes`: Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499.

Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.

    * `route_rules`: The list of HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. routeRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. Within a given pathMatcher, you can set only one of pathRules or routeRules.

      * `priority`: For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

    * `request_headers_to_remove`: A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request before forwarding the request to the backendService.

    * `request_headers_to_add`: Headers to add to a matching request before forwarding the request to the backendService.

      * `header_name`: The name of the header.

      * `header_value`: The value of the header to add.

      * `replace`: If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that were set for that header. The default value is false.

    * `response_headers_to_remove`: A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response before sending the response back to the client.

    * `response_headers_to_add`: Headers to add the response before sending the response back to the client.

      * `header_name`: The name of the header.

      * `header_value`: The value of the header to add.

      * `replace`: If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that were set for that header. The default value is false.

  * `default_custom_error_response_policy`: Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error.

    * `error_response_rules`: Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.

      * `match_response_codes`: Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

      * `path`: The full path to a file within backendBucket . For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters

      * `override_response_code`: The HTTP status code returned with the response containing the custom error content. If overrideResponseCode is not supplied, the same response code returned by the original backend bucket or backend service is returned to the client.

    * `error_service`: The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.

  * `fingerprint`: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field is ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the UrlMap, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a UrlMap.

  * `region`: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional URL map resides. This field is not applicable to global URL maps. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
