Use the `google_dataproc_job` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud Job resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_dataproc_job(job_id: 'value_job_id', project_id: 'value_project_id', region: ' value_region') do
	it { should exist }
	its('driver_output_resource_uri') { should cmp 'value_driveroutputresourceuri' }
	its('driver_control_files_uri') { should cmp 'value_drivercontrolfilesuri' }
