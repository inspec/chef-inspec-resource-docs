Use the `google_compute_resource_policy` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud ResourcePolicy resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_compute_resource_policy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: 'value_region', name: 'value_name') do
	it { should exist }
	its('kind') { should cmp 'value_kind' }
	its('id') { should cmp 'value_id' }
	its('creation_timestamp') { should cmp 'value_creationtimestamp' }
	its('self_link') { should cmp 'value_selflink' }
	its('self_link_with_id') { should cmp 'value_selflinkwithid' }
	its('region') { should cmp 'value_region' }
	its('description') { should cmp 'value_description' }
	its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }
	its('status') { should cmp 'value_status' }
end

describe google_compute_resource_policy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: ' value_region', name: 'value_name') do
	it { should_not exist }

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_resource_policy` resource:


  * `kind`: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#resource_policies for resource policies.

  * `id`: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.

  * `creation_timestamp`: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  * `self_link`: [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.

  * `self_link_with_id`: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.

  * `region`:

  * `description`:

  * `name`: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

  * `vm_maintenance_policy`:

    * `maintenance_window`: A maintenance window for VMs. When set, we restrict our maintenance operations to this window.

      * `daily_maintenance_window`: Time window specified for daily operations.

        * `days_in_cycle`: Defines a schedule with units measured in days. The value determines how many days pass between the start of each cycle.

        * `start_time`: Start time of the window. This must be in UTC format that resolves to one of 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, or 20:00. For example, both 13:00-5 and 08:00 are valid.

        * `duration`: [Output only] A predetermined duration for the window, automatically chosen to be the smallest possible in the given scenario.

    * `concurrency_control_group`: A concurrency control configuration. Defines a group config that, when attached to an instance, recognizes that instance as part of a group of instances where only up the concurrency_limit of instances in that group can undergo simultaneous maintenance. For more information: go/concurrency-control-design-doc

        * `duration`: [Output only] A predetermined duration for the window, automatically chosen to be the smallest possible in the given scenario.

      * `weekly_schedule`: Time window specified for weekly operations.

        * `day_of_weeks`: Up to 7 intervals/windows, one for each day of the week.
