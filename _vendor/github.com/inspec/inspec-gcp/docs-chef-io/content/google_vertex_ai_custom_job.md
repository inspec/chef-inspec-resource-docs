Use the `google_vertex_ai_custom_job` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud CustomJob resource.

## Examples

```ruby
      describe google_vertex_ai_custom_job(name: ' value_name', region: ' value_region') do
     it { should exist }
   end
```

## Properties

Properties that can be accessed from the `google_vertex_ai_custom_job` resource:


  * `error`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

    * `details`: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

    * `code`: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

    * `message`: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

  * `web_access_uris`: Output only. URIs for accessing [interactive shells](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/monitor-debug-interactive-shell) (one URI for each training node). Only available if job_spec.enable_web_access is `true`. The keys are names of each node in the training job; for example, `workerpool0-0` for the primary node, `workerpool1-0` for the first node in the second worker pool, and `workerpool1-1` for the second node in the second worker pool. The values are the URIs for each node's interactive shell.

    * `additional_properties`: 

  * `job_spec`: Represents the spec of a CustomJob.

    * `worker_pool_specs`: Required. The spec of the worker pools including machine type and Docker image. All worker pools except the first one are optional and can be skipped by providing an empty value.

        * `env`: Environment variables to be passed to the container. Maximum limit is 100.

          * `name`: Required. Name of the environment variable. Must be a valid C identifier.

          * `value`: Required. Variables that reference a $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the previous defined environment variables in the container and any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.

        * `args`: The arguments to be passed when starting the container.

        * `command`: The command to be invoked when the container is started. It overrides the entrypoint instruction in Dockerfile when provided.
