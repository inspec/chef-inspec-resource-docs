Use the `google_compute_region_operation` InSpec audit resource to to test a Google Cloud RegionOperation resource.

## Examples

```ruby
describe google_compute_region_operation(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: '', name: 'operation-1641188435323-5d4a6f5b26934-9281422c-dce238f5') do
it { should exist }
its('name') { should eq 'operation-1641188435323-5d4a6f5b26934-9281422c-dce238f5' }
its('status') { should eq '' }
its('progress') { should eq '100' }
end

describe google_compute_region_operation(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: '', name: 'nonexistent') do
it { should_not exist }
end
```
